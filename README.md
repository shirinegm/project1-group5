## Instructions:
1. If you need to look at the yelp api code, you can open the yelp_search.ipynb notebook. It takes one hour to download the dataset. We already have the data in yelp_fastfood_with_duplicates.csv

2. This data and code was put together as Data Science Bootcamp project to perform a Hypothesis test and calculate the correlation between Diabetes prevalence in Illinois from 2011 to 2021 with the number of Fast Food Restaurants over the same period.
